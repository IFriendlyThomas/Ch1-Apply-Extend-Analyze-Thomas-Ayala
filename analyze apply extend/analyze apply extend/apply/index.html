    <p>I am using Visual Studio Code to complete this assignment.</p>

    <p>In chapter 1 I've reviewed in order to plan a website
        it is important to have a goal.
        Analyzing your target audience and competitors contributes to design
        which will allow you to customize a wireframe and sitemap which
        builds up to planning design elements that includes 
        navigation, colors, and graphics.
    </p>

    <p>In This chapter I've learned what it takes to plan website,
     and how to go about building with the basics of html coding.
     I've learned what certain phrases do towards html, and how it works.
